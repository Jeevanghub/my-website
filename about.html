            <p>
                Hi, I’m <strong>Jeevan K</strong> — a Web Development enthusiast based in Bengaluru, India.
                I am currently pursuing my Bachelor of Engineering (2026) and have a strong interest in building modern,
                responsive, and user-friendly web applications.
            </p>

            <p>
                My journey into web development started with curiosity about how websites are structured and styled,
                which led me to build a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
            </p>

            <p>
                I enjoy creating clean interfaces and turning ideas into interactive digital experiences.
                Over time, I have developed the ability to combine logical thinking with creative design
                to build applications that are both functional and visually appealing.
            </p>

            <h3>Projects I Have Worked On</h3>

                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                I am continuously working on improving my frontend development skills,
                exploring modern UI practices, and building projects that enhance user experience and performance.
                My goal is to begin my professional career in web development where I can contribute
                to impactful projects and grow as a developer.
